# HTML-and-CSS-GitHub
My repository for HTML and CSS files on github

Throughout this repository is the collection of all 
the progress i made durring the html and css course.

In this course i was able to become decently competent with this such as: 
HTML doctypes, langs, body elements, text based tags, classes & ids, 
as well as links and href elements.

Learning all of these things and morew has been a blast and i cant wait to further my experience!!
